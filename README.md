# Algorithm-development

I manually picked a point from each cluster.
I found the distance between all points and the points picked from each cluster. There are 3 equations for 3 clusters.
I used idxmin() function to find the minimum value.
The minimum value for distance of a point would show that it belongs to that cluster.
